        <div id="tribute-info">
          Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:
          1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa
          1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program
          known as the "National Youth Administration"
          1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving
          Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
          1937 - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service
          1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles
          Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.
          1941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military
          asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.
          1942 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology
          1944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to
          head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease
          resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
          1945 - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields
          1953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain
          that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
          1962 - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help
          mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
          1970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize
          1983 - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields
          1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University
          2005 - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops
          are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently
          dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called
          it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
          2009 - dies at the age of 95.
          "Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one man's towering
          intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."

          -- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
